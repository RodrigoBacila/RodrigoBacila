Hello.

My name is Rodrigo and I currently work as a backend software engineer, working mainly with C# in .NET Core, SQL with Dapper, SCRUM with Jira and microservices architecture.

I also have experience with technologies such as React (JavaScript / TypeScript), NextJS, HTML, Tailwind CSS, among others that are no longer used in more modern frameworks, especially when we talk about SPAs.

--- About me ---

In the past, I studied and graduated in chemistry, which gave me the mindset of a scientist. Therefore, I usually make decisions based on data and I tend to observe everything with greater attention to detail.

However, I also had a lot of experience in areas that deal with the public, in customer service positions. As a result, I developed a lot of tact and empathy.

My main motivation has always been to do something new, venture responsibly and enjoy each day and/or task, if possible. Good mood is a constant in my day and I will do my best to - organically, without forcing - transfer this good energy to everyone around me, potentially boosting the morale of my teammates and indirectly increasing the efficiency of their respective work.

We are all looking for our dream job, and I believe it starts with the people around us. We have to feel like we belong, join the cause, raise the same flag. Never underestimate the value of a well-placed laugh in a professional environment. This brings people together, and companies are people.

Anyone can learn and absorb more technical knowledge, with so many online courses available today. But, in my opinion, nothing is stronger than the feeling of belonging!

And finally, I'm the guy who doesn't think twice before giving credit where credit is due â€” if someone did something cool, they deserve praise or, at the very least, recognition for it.

We all work with technology, but we are not made of technology. Appreciate the people!
