Hello! 👋

My name is Rodrigo and I currenty work as a software engineer, mainly with **C# in .NET**. I also have experience with other technologies, such as React, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, SQL and so on...

I am currently open to international work, since I speak English fluently and I have reached an intermediate level in French. I am already able to work as a service provider (B2B contracts) 🌎

---

I previously studied and graduated in Chemistry, which gave me the mindset of a scientist 👨‍🔬

With it, I usually make data-driven decisions and look at things with more attention to detail than usual 🔎

Although the Sars-Cov-2 pandemic has caused many disruptions in the professional lives of many people, it is now a key moment for everyone to adapt to what may be a new type of work environment 📡

My main motivation has always been to do something new, to innovate, to adventure responsibly and enjoy each day and/or task. 

We are all searching for our dream job, and I believe that starts with the people around us. We have to feel that we belong, join the cause, raise the same banner 🤝 

One can always learn new technical knowledge, with so many online courses available nowadays. However, in my opinion, nothing is stronger than the feeling of belonging. Therefore, having a cultural fit is already a huge step!

I grew up in a home that always promoted the idea of doing things with excellence, so I adopted this and other values directly into my professional life.
